# Job interview simulator

Use `simulate.py` to simulate data science job interviews from the command line.
The script serves up behavioral and technical questions from a predefined list
as requested by the user. It also includes the option to ask ChatGPT for sample
questions and answers! ChatGPT functionality requires the user to have set up an
API key online and to have stored that API key in a file called 'chatgpt_api_key.txt'
in the same directory as this script. See the [ChatGPT API documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart?context=python) for more information about how to set up an API key.

Good luck!
